# Note Taker
This is part of Challenge 11 - Note Taker for my UT Bootcamp Full Stack program.

## Built With
This application was built with NODE, Express.JS, UUID, Bootstrap, and FS for functionality. This challenge included starter code from the Challenge administrators.

## How to Run the Code
Follow these steps below to use the application:
1. Clone the Repo
2. Install Node using '$ npm install'
3. Install Express using '$ npm install express'
4. Install UUID using '$ npm install uuidv4'
5. Install Bootstrap using '$ npm install bootstrap@3'
6. Review the folders and files for comments to understand the full functionality and associated documentation
7. In the command line enter 'node server.js' to start the server
8. Open the local host on your browser
9. Click 'Get Started' to begin taking notes
10. Save, Update, and Delete Tasks

## Contributions
This was largely an independent project that relied heavily on documentation, trial and error, and the challenge documentation. I referenced the ZOOKEPER activity a lot to get the call functions right. My tutor also was a tremendous help reassuring me that I was not getting logic wrong, it was a syntax issue. Huge kudos to her for this.

## Observations and Challenges
Getting the server, routes, and lib correct was a huge win for me because I felt as if I really started to understand the logic behind the call functions and how Express.JS works. I got the functionality up and running fairly quickly and spent most of my time trying to find the syntax error and working through other errors that came up.

I tested my routes using Insomnia. A tip from my Tutor is to start using NODEMON when working with servers so I don't have to keep starting and stopping them. Yeah, that is definitely helpful for future projects.
